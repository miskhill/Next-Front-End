Wins:
1. Followed the task sheet and I believe all points are covered.
2. Passing in the usernames as initials for each user as there was no photo.
3. Handled incorrect routes with an error page.

Challenges:
1. Testing library had to be installed seperately and had numerous errors initially. In hindsight there may have been a better way to start the Next project with this installed at the same time similarly to a React project.
2. I had an error where one of my page components exports was not resolving to the correct url. Ultimately resolved with a refactor and rename, then back to the original name.

Improvements:
1. I passed in initials for each different user but a photo would be better if it was available.
2. I could flesh out the website a little more but I wanted to show some route handling.
3. More extensive testing.
