## ReadMe

Wins:
1. Followed the task sheet and I believe all points are covered.
2. I use Next most days however I do not usually start a project from scratch. 
3. Passing in the usernames as initials for each user as there was no photo.
4. Handled incorrect routes with an error page.

Challenges:
1. Testing library had to be installed seperately and had numerous errors initially. In hindsight there may have been a better way to start the Next project with this installed at the same time similarly to a React project.
2. I had also used the file extension ts. I ran into testing problems that were resolved by changing the file to tsx.
3. I had an error where one of my page components exports was not resolving to the correct url. Ultimately resolved with a refactor and rename, then back to the original name.
4. I was unable to call the test file Tests and had to resort to src to get the tests to work. I did attempt to alter the configs and type folders but ultimately spent too much time on this so reverted it.

Improvements:
1. I passed in initials for each different user but a photo would be better if it was available.
2. I used a normal image tag when styling my card component but should have used Image from Next.
3. I could flesh out the website a little more but I wanted to show some route handling.
4. More extensive testing.
